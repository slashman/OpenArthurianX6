<div><h3>Hello!</h3><p>We are <a rel="noopener" href="http://slashie.net/">slashie</a> and <a rel="noopener" href="http://jucarave.com/blog/">jucarave</a> (a.k.a Slashing Dragon and Exodus Destiny Dragon from the Ultima Dragons Internet Chapter UDIC). We are two game developers who love classic RPGs and we have quite a bit of indie game development experience behind, including <a rel="noopener" href="http://ananiasgame.com/">Ananias Roguelike</a> (a game available on Steam, iOS and Android with over 100.000 installs), a gamedev youtube <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/jucarave">channel</a> with over 1700 subscribers and many other game projects done for the past 10 years or so.</p><p>In the past, we have worked together in a couple of fan projects including a 3D dungeon crawler remake of Ultima 4 (<a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmWnIsz-wPA">Stygian Abyss</a>), and a demake of Ultima VIII into an even more classic engine. (<a rel="noopener" href="https://blog.slashie.net/category/my-games/morgaelin/">Morgaelin</a>)&nbsp;</p><p>For a long time, we have wanted to create a tool which allows fans from classic game franchises to bring their reconstruction and fan projects into reality. With your help this can be a reality!</p><p>We are planning to create an open source&nbsp;game engine from scratch with which you'll be able to create your own adventures. It will come packed with ready to use content based on&nbsp;Denzi's cc-by-sa &nbsp;3.0 <a rel="noopener" href="https://opengameart.org/content/denzis-16x16-oblique-tilesets">oblique&nbsp;tileset</a>, so you can jump straight into map making, NPC design and scripting to develop your game.</p><p>You can see demonstrations of the engine&nbsp;<a rel="noopener" href="http://slashware.net/oax6/demos.html">here</a> (we'll be posting more as development goes onward with your contributions)</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img style="max-width:620px;" src="https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_620/v1496206439/lnybu1q3jzh4frp71keo.png" /></p></div><div><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>We need funding for the following</p><ul><li>Developing the game engine (and potentially the Game Editor)</li><li>Expanding the tile set as needed</li><li>Creating a library of reusable pieces of content</li></ul><p>All the development (both software and art) will be released under an open license so you can use it in both free and commercial projects.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img style="max-width:620px;" src="https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_620/v1496206460/fu2eovcdhxo3g8xue2du.png" /></p><p><strong>Base Goal ($2.000)</strong></p><p>We will deliver a free, open source game engine which you can readily use for your project including a content pack (Medieval Fantasy).
